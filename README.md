# Nick's Slices

A fake pizza company built with the intent of learning Gatsby, building/deploying a "headless" site, and staying sharp with React.

I really loved working on this project and now am pretty sold on Gatsby (and static site generation & the whole "headless" CMS thing in general... these sites are fast as f\*\*\* ‚ö°Ô∏è and easy to maintain for React devs).

Also - I've worked with GraphQL quite a bit now and I gotta say, I'm a huge fan. It makes it so easy to shape the data coming back from the DB, and not to mention, no more heckling the backend devs anymore to alter the REST API's... so it's a win/win.

## A JAMstack site built with:

- Gatsby
- (React... under the hood of Gatsby)
- GraphQL
- Sanity.io
- Netlify (for CI/CD and serverless functions)
- Styled Components
