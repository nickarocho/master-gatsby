# Nick's Slices

A fake pizza company built with the intent of learning Gatsby, building/deploying a "headless" site, and staying sharp with React.

I really loved working on this project and now am pretty sold on Gatsby (and static site generation & the whole "headless" CMS thing in general... these sites are fast as f\*\*\* ⚡️ and easy to maintain for React devs).

## A JAMstack site built with:

- Gatsby
- (React... under the hood of Gatsby)
- GraphQL
- Sanity.io
- Netlify (for CI/CD and serverless functions)
- Styled Components
